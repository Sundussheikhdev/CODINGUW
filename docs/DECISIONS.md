# Architecture Decisions

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure
- **Decision:** Used a monorepo with `/apps/frontend` and `/apps/backend`
- **Rationale:** Simplifies development, shared types, single deployment pipeline
- **Trade-off:** Slightly more complex than separate repos, but better for this vertical slice

### Database Choice
- **Decision:** SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Rationale:** Fast setup, no external dependencies, perfect for MVP/demo
- **Trade-off:** Not production-ready for scale, but ideal for 3-6 hour test

### ID Generation
- **Decision:** CUID instead of UUID for all primary keys
- **Rationale:** Shorter, URL-safe, sortable by creation time
- **Trade-off:** Less standard than UUID, but better UX for URLs

### Authentication Strategy
- **Decision:** Simple email-based session (no full auth provider)
- **Rationale:** Speed of development, meets "don't leave endpoints wide open" requirement
- **Trade-off:** Not production-ready, but sufficient for demo

### File Storage
- **Decision:** Local file storage in `/uploads` directory
- **Rationale:** Simple, no external dependencies, works for demo
- **Trade-off:** Not scalable, but perfect for MVP

### Mock Integrations
- **Decision:** Mock Persona KYC and Plaid financial linking
- **Rationale:** Meets requirements without complex sandbox setup
- **Trade-off:** Not real integrations, but demonstrates architecture

### Validation Strategy
- **Decision:** Zod schemas on both frontend and backend
- **Rationale:** Type safety, consistent validation, great DX
- **Trade-off:** Slight duplication, but worth it for safety

### State Management
- **Decision:** React state + API client (no Redux/Zustand)
- **Rationale:** Simple, sufficient for this scope
- **Trade-off:** Could get complex with more features

### Styling Approach
- **Decision:** Tailwind CSS with component-based design
- **Rationale:** Fast development, consistent design, responsive
- **Trade-off:** Learning curve, but very productive

### Error Handling
- **Decision:** Try-catch with user-friendly error messages
- **Rationale:** Simple, effective for this scope
- **Trade-off:** Could be more sophisticated with error boundaries

### Testing Strategy
- **Decision:** Basic API tests with Vitest
- **Rationale:** Shows testing capability without over-engineering
- **Trade-off:** Not comprehensive, but demonstrates testing approach

### Security Measures
- **Decision:** Basic hardening (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, file restrictions)
- **Rationale:** Meets security requirements without over-engineering
- **Trade-off:** Not enterprise-grade, but appropriate for demo

### Deployment Strategy
- **Decision:** Docker containers with docker-compose
- **Rationale:** Easy local development, ready for cloud deployment
- **Trade-off:** Adds complexity, but standard practice

### Real-time Features
- **Decision:** Polling for notifications (no WebSocket)
- **Rationale:** Simple, works reliably, sufficient for demo
- **Trade-off:** Not real-time, but meets requirements

### Code Organization
- **Decision:** Feature-based organization with shared types
- **Rationale:** Clear separation, easy to navigate
- **Trade-off:** Some duplication, but better maintainability

### Performance Considerations
- **Decision:** Basic optimizations (file size limits, rate limiting)
- **Rationale:** Appropriate for demo scope
- **Trade-off:** Not heavily optimized, but sufficient

### Documentation
- **Decision:** Comprehensive README with clear setup instructions
- **Rationale:** Essential for demo evaluation
- **Trade-off:** Time investment, but critical for success
